# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based solution for detecting driver drowsiness using computer vision techniques and machine learning. Drowsy driving is a significant safety concern, and this project aims to mitigate the risks associated with it by monitoring the driver's alertness in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Drowsiness Detection:** Utilizes computer vision to analyze facial features and assess the driver's level of drowsiness in real-time.

- **Alert Mechanism:** Implements an alert system that triggers warnings, such as sound alerts or visual cues, when signs of drowsiness are detected.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Designed to work on various platforms, ensuring flexibility for integration into different vehicle systems.

- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows users to adjust sensitivity and other parameters to fine-tune the detection system based on individual preferences and conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- NumPy
- playsound (for alert sounds, optional)
